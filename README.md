There are lung X-ray images of people suffering from pneumonia and healthy people. The model was developed with the CNNs method in line with the images downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). The web page was created to integrate the created model with the Flask. In addition, it is aimed to give information about the model and disease on the web page. Users will be able to evaluate themselves in line with their knowledge, show their own x-ray images and understand whether they are suffering from the disease. Don't you know how to run the flask? Please take a look at [VS Code Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask).
